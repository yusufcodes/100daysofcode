Hour 1

Already done:
Addition of a new function in UIController: clearFields

Completed this hour:
Addition of querySelectorAll to get the two elements we want to clear the fields of, stored in fiels variable.
Used the following to convert the list to an array: Array.prototype.slice.call(fields).
Used the 'forEach' function on the Array, which sets the value of the current array to "".

We have access to the following in the forEach function:
-current: the current item in the forEach loop
-index: the position of the array that is being worked on
-array: the actual array we are functioning on.
