Hour 1
Wrote a function simply to return a set of values in an object 'getBudget'
Quick code review of the budget controller - the 'data' controller
Wrote my version of manipulating the DOM, need to review the lecturer's way of producing the same outcome
*Instructor used textContent, I went with innerHTML
textContent: better performance as the text is not parsed as HTML, and prevents XSS attacks
(where malicious code could be injected into the site)
