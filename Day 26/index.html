                <h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
                <p>I want to be able to simply help other people in the best way I can. This could simply be enhancing the UX of an application, or creating a new app/website to make people's lives easier. </p>

                <p>I'm currently studying my second year of Computer Science where I'm building on my knowledge from first year and also learning some new things (see portfolio below).</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I'm enhancing my knowledge of front end web development. I started off with HTML and CSS, and now understanding the basics of the two, I am delving deeper into the world of JavaScript. I am using a Udemy course to further my knowledge of JS.</p>
