Started Coding Challenge 2.

Struggled with challenge: how would we save the user's input, and change the value in JavaScript, without refreshing the page? (user value would be lost) - making notes as I follow solution to problem.

Problem solved: this function needed to occur each time the user clicked 'hold' button, which I didn't think about previously.
