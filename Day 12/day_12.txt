Hour 1
Started working on extra hours calculator
Wrote up basic HTML for the user to enter their hours for the month
Added event listener to the button, problems:
Input taken as a string - used parseInt to convert
No validation in case no value is entered - can be added later

Features to add:
-Convert hour value (such as 1.45 to the equivalent whole number)
-Round values
